Work Day Scheduler

Hello! This app is used for planning out your work day using "Moment" JavaScript along with jQuery.
You can input an activity into each hour slot (9am-4pm) and submit
your input with a save button (uses local storage). 
This assignment uses jQuery to dynamically place time blocks onto the webpage and allow users to input text and save it.
