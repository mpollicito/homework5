Work Day Scheduler
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello! This assignment was to create an app for planning out your work day using "Moment" JavaScript along with jQuery to do dynamicals 
You can input an activity into each hour slot (9am-4pm) and submit
your input with a save button (uses local storage).
Depending on the time you are trying to write in the input field, the time blocks will be color coded. 
This will be useful for someone who wants to be certain if the said hour has passed!
